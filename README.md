Pptx Extractor [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Label305/PptxExtractor.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/Label305/PptxExtractor)
=============

PHP library for extracting and replacing string data in .pptx files. Pptx files are zip archives filled with XML documents and assets. Their format is described by [OOXML](http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_Open_XML). This library only manipulates the `ppt/slide.xml` (of slide1.xml, slide2.xml) files.

Composer installation
---

```json
"require": {
    "label305/pptx-extractor": "0.2.*"
}
```
Requirements
----
- PHP 8.0
- PHP ext-dom
- PHP ext-zip
- PHP ext-libxml

Basic usage
----

Import the basic classes.

```php
use Label305\PptxExtractor\Basic\BasicExtractor;
use Label305\PptxExtractor\Basic\BasicInjector;
```

First we need to extract all the contents from an existing `pptx` file. This can be done using the `BasicExtractor`. Calling `extractStringsAndCreateMappingFile` will create a new file which name you pass in the second argument. This new file contains references so the library knows where to later inject the altered text back into.

```php
$extractor = new BasicExtractor();
$mapping = $extractor->extractStringsAndCreateMappingFile(
    'simple-slides.pptx',
    'simple-slides-extracted.pptx'
  );
```

Now that you have extracted contents you can inspect the content of the resulting `$mapping` array. And if you wish to change the content you can simply modify it. The array key maps to a symbol in the `simple-slides-extracted.pptx`.

```php
echo $mapping[0][0]; // Slide number one
```

Now after you changed your content, you can save it back to a new file. In this case that file is `simple-slides-injected.pptx`.

```php
$mapping[0][0] = "Slide number one";

$injector = new BasicInjector();
$injector->injectMappingAndCreateNewFile(
    $mapping,
    'simple-slides-extracted.pptx',
    'simple-slides-injected.pptx'
  );
```

Advanced usage
----

The library is also equiped with a `DecoratedTextExtractor` and `DecoratedTextInjector` with which you can manipulate basic paragraph styling like bold, italic and underline. You can also use the `SharedString` objects to distinguish logical groupings of text.

```php
$extractor = new DecoratedTextExtractor();
$mapping = $extractor->extractStringsAndCreateMappingFile(
    'markup.pptx',
    'markup-extracted.pptx'
  );
  
$firstParagraph = $mapping[0]; // Paragraph object
$$firstTextRun = $firstParagraph[0]; // TextRun object

$firstTextRun->italic = true;
$firstTextRun->bold = false;
$firstTextRun->underline = true;

echo $firstTextRun->text; // The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog
$firstTextRun->text = "Several fabulous dixieland jazz groups played with quick tempo.";

$injector = new DecoratedTextInjector();
$injector->injectMappingAndCreateNewFile(
    $mapping,
    'markup-extracted.pptx',
    'markup-injected.pptx'
  );
```
